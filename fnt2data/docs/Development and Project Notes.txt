This is a command-line tool for converting Atari 8-bit binary .FNT files into "data" statements for various Atari 8-bit/6502 Assemblers and programming languages (e.g. Atari BASIC).

.FNT files are comprised of 128 character definitions, each 8-bits wide by 8-scan-lines tall, and beginning with the 8-bit bitmap (byte) for the top-most scan-line of character 0. The 9th byte (index 8) in the .FNT file would be the first scan-line for the 2nd character, etc.

Output is a series of "data" statements, such as (data for first 2 characters):

.BYTE $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $00, $38, $38, $38, $10, $00, $38, $38, $00

## Planned Features/Functions ##

    * Create .BYTE, .HE, dta (etc.) statements, for various Assemblers, that
      represent the character set data from a standard Atari -bit .FNT file.

    * Create DATA statements for Atari BASIC (and possibly other "BASICs")

    * Configurable data-type output ($HEX, HEX, DEC, %Binary)

    * Configurable number of characters per line.

## Prototype Commands ##

  show:

    -b --boxes - Shows bounding boxes around characters (default OFF)
    -c --chars_per_line - 1, 8, 16 - Number of chars per line (default 8)

    FILENAME

  convert:

    * Will use SUBCOMMANDS to make command lines more logical (no need to have
      irrelevant options for each format)

    -f --format [BIN | DEC | HEX]
    -s --separator [comma | space]
    -d --directive [.BYTE, .HE, dta]
    -b --bytes_per_line
    -p --pad - flag, add a space after seperating commas

    If directive == HE, automatically omit the $ prefix.
    
## DATA Command Format Notes ##

ATASM (and MAC/65):

  .BYTE

  Value prefixes:

    No Prefix - Decimal
    $ - Hex
    ~ - Binary

  Comma-separated.

MADS:

  .BYTE
  .HE
  dta

  Value Prefixes:

    No Prefix - Decimal
    $ - Hex
    % - Binary

  Comma OR Space separated
