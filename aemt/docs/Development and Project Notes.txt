[A]tari [E]ight-bit [M]ulti-[T]ool - aemt.py

  This is a command-line tool, intended to provide some "quality of life"
  improvements to managing large game/program libraries, on USB Media, for
  the "Atari THE400 Mini" (with utilities for other Atari 8-bit emulators).

  Current functionality includes:

	* Moving files, in bulk, to organized folder structures - with the ability
	  to control how the organization is done and to limit the number of files
	  per folder (to avoid exceeding "THE400 Minis" 255 files-per-folder limit).

	* Creating, applying, and updating .cfg files automatically, WITHOUT having
	  to set them individually, one game at a time, from within "THE400 Mini's"
	  file browser.

	* Identify and validate CARTRIDGE files (".car" and ".c01" to ".c70"),
	  including decoding the header, showing the stored ROM data checksum and
	  computing the actual checksum of the contained ROM data.

  Only the ".cfg" file functionality is specific to "THE400 Mini"; the other
  functions can be used with any Atari 8-bit emulators/systems.

## Coming Features/Functions: ##

  * The ability to CREATE .car (etc.) format files from RAW binary ROM dumps.

  * .ATR (etc.) identification and verification.

  * Image "fingerprinting" - which will create unique "fingerprints" that
    PRECISELY identify a file, version, origin, format and so on.
	
	The goal is that it becomes easy, and reliable, to know what version of a
	file you have without relying on the filename and various, complex,
	unreliable,	conventions.

	When done, this will feed an open, online, database, against which you
	can cross-reference the files you HAVE, as well as obtain the fingerprints
	of the versions you might be looking for.

	(Note: Tthis feature is not limited to "THE400 Mini" or Atari 8-bit
	platforms, and it is my intent to build it in a fashion that'll work for
	any game or program image file, regardless of platform.)

## Technical/Implementation Notes: ##

  * This is currently written in Python (3.12.2).

    Distributing Python applications is a little fussy, and can be a challenge
	for those not used to using them.  If there is sufficient interest, I may
	create a .NET, Java or RUST version that can be distributed and used more
	conventionally.

  * Code largely follows PEP-8, though I make occaisional exceptions (mostly to
    line-length) where it IMPROVES readability.

  * It has only been tested on macOS; though there is nothing specific to what
    it does that should cause issues on Linux or Windows.

  * Dependencies are in the "requirements.txt" file.  As of now there is only
    ONE; which is the "click" module used to implement the rich CLI.

  * There is one overall program, "aemt.py", within which mutliple commands and
    sub-commands are available.

	The individual commands are created in a way which allows you to use them
	DIRECTLY as if they were their own, self-contained, tools.  So you can use:

	  aemt.py split ...

	or:

	  split.py ...

	See "Usage", below, for more information.
