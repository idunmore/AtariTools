Usage:

  split - (was "partition")

  Options:

  	-s, --scheme 	[simple | max_files | bands]
  	-f, --force 	flag - forces max files per folder, turning off "grouping"
  	-v, --verbose  [silent | progress | log], or just 0-2

<--[ CLI STRUCTURE ]-->

# Commands: #

	? Does it make sense to have seperate commands, with dedicated options,
	  for each of the different splitting "schemes"?
	  	 
		 - This would be instead of using a "--scheme" option:

		 	Instead of:
			  
			  amet.py split --scheme [simple|max|bands]

			It would be:

			  amet.py split ...
			  amet.py partition ...
			  amet.py band ...

		- Would allow each "scheme" to have its own, non-colliding, OPTIONS:

			* amet.py split (NO UNIQUE OPTIONS)
			* amet.py partition -g -max_files 50
			* amet.py bands -b "0-9,A-E,F-Z"

<--[ TODOS ]-->

- TODO: Can both START and END PREFIXES be handled in a single pass?
- TODO: Bands can only start and end with a single character; consider making
		it possible to use ranges like "AS-AT", not just "A-F" etc.

<--[ DESIGN & BEHAVIOR NOTEPAD ]-->

# Class Structures: #

	Folder = One Folder

		? Should it be able to create its own folder name based on its content?
		? Should it be given a name by the Splitter?

	Folders = All Folders (Collection of Folder)

		* This is just a representation/container.
		! It is created by the Splitter.
	 
# Splitters #

  * [DONE] Simple by Folder (0-9, A, B, C ...)

  * Max Files per Folder (dynamic folder names, 0-9, A-D, E-Er, Es-Ez)
  	  - Has a "Preserve Name Groups" option, which can reduce the size of a
  	    group to avoid splitting groups across prefix boundaries

  * Bands is pre-determined name groups, with no limit to # files (0-9, A-E, etc.)

? Questions ?

	? Is there value in multi-tierd splitting (S, contains SAA, SBA, STA etc.)?

	  	- Is that preferable to tyring to automatically do E-G?
	  	- Is it simpler?
	  	- Is the second part of the folder name needed in this case?
